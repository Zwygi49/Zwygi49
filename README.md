- 👋 Hi, I’m @Zwygi49, an happy Linux user that switched 100% to Linux about 2 years ago comming from the Apple Eco system.
- 👀 I’m interested in getting a better linux user, learning how to efficiently use Github, and help the open source community where I can, even if my contribution as new user and non programmer will be limited.
- 🌱 I’m currently investing time in better learning linux, starting with easy bash scripting.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple project may be doing some testing or helping in documentation, I speak French (mother language) and German
- 📫 I can be reached by email or @zwygi49:matrix.org or Zwygi49 on Signal
